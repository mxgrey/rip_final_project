\begin{abstract}

The author uses a Jacobian-based collision avoidance algorithm which leverages convex collision geometries to detect and escape collisions prior to them happening. The algorithm is efficient enough to be run in real time, but can also be used to adjust an existing trajectory prior to execution. The focus of this algorithm is on efficiency and makes no attempt to offer any guarantees on completeness or optimality.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Collision avoidance is of critical importance for high degree-of-freedom robots, because physical collisions can result in damage to the robot, the environment, or even human beings in the workspace of the robot. Motion planning algorithms can be used to generate collision-free paths for robot links. These algorithms can be complete \cite{Lozano} or probabilistically complete \cite{PRM}\cite{RRT}. Alternatively, collision avoidance can be handled on a lower level, for example using the concept of artificial potential fields \cite{Khatib}.

Complete and probabilistically complete motion plan generation for high-dimensional configuration spaces is computationally expensive, sometimes to the point of not being viable. Moreover, the human safety aspect demands that the ability to detect and avoid collisions rapidly. A planner which requires a run-time that exceeds real-time speeds is not an acceptable method for handling these critical situations. If a trajectory needs to be replanned in order to handle an unexpected collision (for example, a newly introduced obstacle in the environment), it would be undesirable to use a sampling-based motion planner that might take arbitrarily long to produce a solution. 

Instead, for the sake of efficiency, this paper explores an algorithm analogous to the artificial potential field concept of Khatib \cite{Khatib} except that it does not use the potential fields to achieve a particular goal configuration. In this paper, potential fields are merely used to adjust an existing trajectory, and they only exist when the collision geometry of the robot intersects itself or an obstacle. The premise is that a planner (or some other source) has generated a trajectory to be executed on the robot, but a new obstacle was introduced some time after the plan was generated (for example, at runtime). After the potential field adjustment, cubic splines are used to cleanly and efficiently mesh a collision-free trajectory segment into the original trajectory. This can be useful if an arbitrary trajectory is provided without any knowledge of the trajectory's objective function or goal, but the trajectory needs to be resolved to avoid collisions with minimal changes to its overall path and end configuration.



\section{METHODS}

\subsection{Convex Continuous Collision Detection}

The first key component of the algorithm is the ability to continuously detect collisions between convex geometries. This was noted as a requirement by Khatib for the use of potential fields \cite{Khatib}. To this end, the algorithm uses libccd\footnote{Information on libccd can be found here: \url{http://libccd.danfis.cz/about}}. ``Continuous collision detection'' in this context means that, in addition to simply identifying when a collision occurs, we know which point on each geometry most deeply intersects the offending geometry. This also means that we have a vector to indicate what direction each geometry could be moved in to reduce the amount of collision, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:thigh_punch_collision}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pictures/thigh_punch_collision}
\caption{Collision geometry and collision normals of the left fist in the left thigh}
\label{fig:thigh_punch_collision}
\end{figure}

The collision geometries are generally represented as spheres, capsules (a.k.a. pills or cylinders with spherical caps), and boxes. These are simple convex shapes which do a respectable job of encapsulating the complex geometry of the robot. By combining these shapes in clever ways (see Fig. , they can offer a good compromise between accuracy, safety buffer, and efficiency.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
